# Readme

Many of the files in this repository are original to https://github.com/sfujim/TD3 - the code from the original authors of TD3, the learning algorithm we utilize in our notebooks here; including the contained readme below.  To dive in to our own content, the ModifyingRL.ipynb notebook is a great place to start and can be seen as a more comprehensive readme for the things we're demonstrating here.

## Introduction
The exercises (notebooks) in this repo comprise a short course for data scientists and other practitioners covering the practical considerations needed to effectively apply reinforcement learning to real-world problems.  The course uses a simulation environment (Robot Ant) that simplifies some aspects of implementation but addresses real, Physics-based learning tasks.

See the [docs]() for more.
