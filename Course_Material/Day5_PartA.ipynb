    "- **Simulation environment**: Notice that this is not the same as the python/conda environment.  The simulation environment is the simulated world where the reinforcement learning takes place.  It provides opportunities for an agent to learn and explore, and ideally provides challenges that aid in efficient learning.\n",
    "- **Agent (aka actor or policy)**: An entity in the simulation environment that performs actions.  The agent could be a person, a robot, a car, a thermostat, etc.\n",
    "- **State variable**: An observed variable in the simulation environment.  They can be coordinates of objects or entities, an amount of fuel in a tank, air temperature, wind speed, etc.\n",
    "- **Action variable**: An action that the agent can perform.  Examples: step forward, increase velocity to 552.5 knots, push object left with force of 212.3 N, etc.\n",
    "- **Reward**: A value given to the agent for doing something considered to be 'good'.  Reward is commonly assigned at each time step and cumulated during a learning episode.\n",
    "- **Episode**: A learning event consisting of multiple steps in which the agent can explore.  It starts with the unmodified environment and continues until the goal is achieved or something prevents further progress, such as a robot getting stuck in a hole.  Multiple episodes are typically run in loops until the model is fully trained.\n",
    "- **Model (aka policy or agent)**: An RL model is composed of the modeling architecture (e.g., neural network) and parameters or weights that define the unique behavior of the model.\n",
    "- **Policy (aka model or agent)**: The parameters of a model that encode the best choices to make in an environment.  The choices are not necessarily good ones until the model undergoes training.  The policy (or model) is the \"brain\" of the agent.\n",
    "- **Replay Buffer**: A place in memory to store state, action, reward and other variables describing environmental state transitions. It is effectively the agent's memory of past experiences.\n",
    "- **On-policy**: The value of the next action is determined using the current actor policy.\n",
    "- **Off-policy**: The value of the next action is determined by a function, such as a value function, instead of the current actor policy.\n",
    "- **Value function**: Function (typically a neural network) used to estimate the value, or expected reward, of an action."

    "The main challenges in this first type of multi-agent RL are usually dev-ops questions of scaling and collecting/communicating information correctly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of MARL is the harder bit - and it is harder - that is, many *different* agents learning to play individual parts in a larger group.  In this case, we have to consider how multiple agents learn in the context of environment stationarity (whether changes in the environment caused by one agent affect the actions taken by another, independent agent).  If each agent is learning, then each agent's behavior is changing over time.  From one agent's perspective, all other agents can be considered part of the environment, and if those agents are changing behavior over time, the environment is changing over time.  The time needed to learn in this kind of rapidly changing environment increases greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to view this problem is that the policy becomes a moving target.  The goal is for the agent (policy) to learn to anticipate all of the state-action transitions in the environment.  However, if those transitions are changing over time, the policy will have a difficult time converging on a solution that appears to be changing as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the first type of \"pooled learning\" MARL, each agent usually has its own environment to explore (vectorized or parallel environments).  In those cases, the effect of actions taken by an agent are generally easier for the algorithm to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of relying on the same algorithms used to train single angents, MARL algorithms are being developed to handle the new complexities of this kind of RL."
